% Changes made (April 1, 2013)      Supratim Ray - commit c4e44518e1c2

1. At present having different contrast values for mapping/task gabor is leadng to computer errors. It appears that the GRFContrastKey is not getting set properly: if the lablib.knot.plist is removed and this code is run, it does not register "GRF0/1/2GaborContrast" although the other variables are set. The number of computer errors decrease (but does not become zero) if the we stop storing and restoring Gabors in the presentStimSequence method of GRFStimuli.
2. In the instruction trials, mapping stimuli are now set to null.
3. shuffleStimList is now modified to shuffle the stimList.
4. Removed some unused keys.

1. Include option to convert a gabor to a grating, hide task gabor (which then becomes a fixation task if percentage of catch trials is set to 100%) and either of the two mapping gabors, and an option to count stimuli in the done list for catch trial.
2. Put digital codes for each stimulus so that the entire mapping sequence (one side) can be reconstructed from the data stream directly. Digital codes can be presented for only one mapping stimulus.

1. Bug: in GaborRFMap.nib, contrastPC0 was added to GRFStimTablesCounts (attributes inspector) instead of GRFStimTablesController. This has been changed. In addition, GRFStimTablesCount's attributes inspector showed GRFMappingBlocks and GRFTaskStatus. These have been removed. Making these changes still do not fix the issue of having computer errors when two gabors have different contrasts.

1. Include option to change the temporal frequency of the mapping stimuli (7th parameter). kMaxMapValues reduced to 6 otherwise the program crashes. Temporal modulation parameter is also added for mapping stimuli.

% Desired changes (22/03/13) Supratim Ray

At present doneList in GRFMapStimTable is maintained as a 6-D array with kMaxMapValues = 8 entires per dimension, which needs 8^6 bytes. If fewer number of entries are used per parameter (say numAzi=1), we are unnecessarily dealing with a large and sparse matrix. Instead, this list should be constructed dynamically (7-D array of size numAzi*numEle*numSigma*numSF*numOri*numCon*numTF). This will allow us to increase the number of possible entries (kMaxMapValues) as long as all the parameters are not large simultaneously.

Check whether both digital codes and reward/eyedata etc can be controlled using a single ITC.

The code gives computer errors if contrast is different from 100%.          (22/03/13)  Supratim Ray
