% Changes made (April 1, 2013)      Supratim Ray - commit c4e44518e1c2

1. At present having different contrast values for mapping/task gabor is leadng to computer errors. It appears that the GRFContrastKey is not getting set properly: if the lablib.knot.plist is removed and this code is run, it does not register "GRF0/1/2GaborContrast" although the other variables are set. The number of computer errors decrease (but does not become zero) if the we stop storing and restoring Gabors in the presentStimSequence method of GRFStimuli.
2. In the instruction trials, mapping stimuli are now set to null.
3. shuffleStimList is now modified to shuffle the stimList.
4. Removed some unused keys.

% Changes made (April 2, 2013)      Supratim Ray - commit 9cd457375427

1. Include option to convert a gabor to a grating, hide task gabor (which then becomes a fixation task if percentage of catch trials is set to 100%) and either of the two mapping gabors, and an option to count stimuli in the done list for catch trial.
2. Put digital codes for each stimulus so that the entire mapping sequence (one side) can be reconstructed from the data stream directly. Digital codes can be presented for only one mapping stimulus.

% Changes made (April 3, 2013)      Supratim Ray - commit 3b0ee909a9e5

1. Bug: in GaborRFMap.nib, contrastPC0 was added to GRFStimTablesCounts (attributes inspector) instead of GRFStimTablesController. This has been changed. In addition, GRFStimTablesCount's attributes inspector showed GRFMappingBlocks and GRFTaskStatus. These have been removed. Making these changes still do not fix the issue of having computer errors when two gabors have different contrasts.

% Changes made (April 4, 2013)      Supratim Ray - commit a33f3a2f4e8c

1. Include option to change the temporal frequency of the mapping stimuli (7th parameter). kMaxMapValues reduced to 6 otherwise the program crashes. Temporal modulation parameter is also added for mapping stimuli.

1. Include option to send digital codes and control reward circuit using a single ITC18.

% Desired changes (22/03/13) Supratim Ray

At present doneList in GRFMapStimTable is maintained as a 6-D array with kMaxMapValues = 8 entires per dimension, which needs 8^6 bytes. If fewer number of entries are used per parameter (say numAzi=1), we are unnecessarily dealing with a large and sparse matrix. Instead, this list should be constructed dynamically (7-D array of size numAzi*numEle*numSigma*numSF*numOri*numCon*numTF). This will allow us to increase the number of possible entries (kMaxMapValues) as long as all the parameters are not large simultaneously.

The code gives computer errors if contrast is different from 100%.          (22/03/13)  Supratim Ray

VINAY: All the changes made here (from GRFMap to CRSMap code) are indicated in comments alongside the change. Changes made in the list are not indicated by comments however. 

----------
vinay: 03 July 2014
While merging the changes from the updated GaborRFMap into CRSMap, only the nib files weren't copied/updated. Therefore the EyeXY window wasn't the updated version (with additional options' buttons). Therefore, I have copied just this nib file - 'CRSEyeXYController.nib' from the cloned version of the updated GabroRFMap to this CRSMap. This is working now.
The same can't be done in the case of the 'Stimulus Mapping' window in CRSMap.nib since there are a lot of additional buttons in the case of CRSMap. Therefore, I am just adding this option 'Use Single ITC18' by copying just this button from GaborRFMap.nib to CRSMap.nib and making the necessary customizations/changes for CRSMap.

---------
vinay: 04 July 2014
Somehow I can't change the tags in CRSEyeXYController.nib file from 'GRF' to 'CRS' in the version editor (bare text format). So there are some 'GRF' tags in this file. Need to change them to 'CRS'

---------
vinay: 04 July 2014
Added the 'Annulus Fixed Protocol' to CRSMap. This now corresponds to protocolNumber = 10
Added 'Tool Tip's in the 'specific protocol' selection panel. These tips tell which of C, R, S and which of their parameters have to be set for every protocol

---------
vinay: 11 August 2014
Code to send the protocolNumber (to identify the specific sub-protocol) as a digital code added. Sending with the first trial of a protocol (at the beginning or after ‘RESET’). This part was added to CRSDigitalOut.m and CRSStarttrialState.m. Here we check for the value of trialNumber and send the code if it is 1. Whenever the experiment begins or is 'RESET' trialNumber is reset to 0 and it increments to 1 for the first trial.
Changes to map temporal frequency similar to contrast added (from GaborRFMap (modified)). Limit the tf max value to frameRate/2 and change the temporalPhase to 90 deg at this max value to capture the maximum’s rather than the minimum’s and draw the stimulus correctly. These modifications have been copied from the modified GaborRFMap. Choose this if you want to enable static as well as moving gratings. With log mapping if the min is set to 0 (for static gratings) then all the values are pulled to 0 and one gets only static gratings. Change this to linear mapping (if required so) otherwise.

---------
vinay 10 Sep 2014:
   - Changed some remaining GRF’ instances in CRSEyeXYController.nib to ‘CRS’
   - Modified logValueWithIndex for count=2 case. min and max are the 2 values assigned now in this case
   Commit these changes before modifying the digital out parameters under specific protocols to reduce the digital out load
   
   The dual phase protocol does not draw the phase shifts between centre and ring gabors for non-zero TFs i.e. for drifting gabors. May have to change the temporal modulation code to correct this
   The corss-orientation protocol also does not show both the two gabors, but only the ring gabor. Have to check this
   
---------
vinay 15 Sep 2014:
Modified the amount of digital code sent for each gabor depending on the specific protocol that is being run.
This prevents computer errors that were happening for all protocols where 3 gabors were being drawn (and subsequently digital codes for all 3 were being sent)
The digtal codes sent for each such protocol have been reduced now and the computer errors are not arising any more for those protocols.

Including comments in Notes after a long long long time. All the comments until now have been incluced at the relevant places in the code (which shall continue anyway).
- I have included an option to draw the ring and centre gabors with a lag after drawing the surround gabor. In short, the stimOnFrame of the Ring and Centre gabors are advanced by the number of frames determined from the specified lag (the value in millisecinds is converted to the equivalent number of frames). This happens only when the lag option is enabled/checked.
- protocolNumber is now being saved in behaviorSetting as well
- lagGabors (boolean flag) and the value of lag in milliseconds, lagGaborsMS, are saved under stimSetting. The value, lagGaborsMS, is also put out as a digital event (when lagGabors is enabled) before the first trial only.
